This is my attempt at writting a C/C++ based hardware monitor on Ubunto 16.04 LTS.  I'm running as Asus R4BE motherboard which comes with many sensors all of which i'm trying to get a read out for.  

Yes, I'm totally re-inventing the over-invented wheel is hardware monitoring tools, but this is the best project I could come up with to get into C++ on Linux. The intention is to get somewhat familiar with C++, QT and the Linux environment.  With emphysis on C++.

I've taken some inspiration from https://github.com/karelzak/util-linux/blob/master/sys-utils/lscpu.c especially around the area of locating the correct files that hold the sensor data.
